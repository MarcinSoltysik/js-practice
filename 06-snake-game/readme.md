## Description

This project is a simple browser-based Snake game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a grid-based game board where the player controls a snake, attempting to eat food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the boundaries and itself. The user interacts with the game through keyboard inputs, navigating the snake in four directions. The game displays the current score, high score, and provides instructions for starting and restarting the game.

## Technologies Used:

The project utilizes HTML for defining the structure of the game board, CSS for styling elements, and JavaScript for implementing game logic and interactivity. DOM manipulation is employed to dynamically update the game board, snake, and other elements in response to user input and game events.

## Learning Opportunities:

DOM Manipulation: Gain hands-on experience with Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, updating and interacting with HTML elements dynamically based on game events and user input.
Game Logic Implementation: Learn how to implement basic game logic such as handling player input, updating the game state, and checking for collisions.
Event Handling: Understand the use of event listeners in JavaScript to capture and respond to keyboard events for controlling game actions.
Interval-Based Animation: Explore the concept of interval-based animation for continuous movement of game elements and dynamic updates.
By examining and modifying this code, you can enhance your understanding of web development concepts and game programming fundamentals.
