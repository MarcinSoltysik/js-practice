      <p>
        A modal window in JavaScript (also known as a modal dialog or a modal
        popup) is a user interface element that appears on top of the main
        content and requires the user to interact with it before they can
        continue interacting with the rest of the page. It is commonly used to
        display important information, prompt for user input, or confirm an
        action.

      <h2>Essential Characteristics of Modal Windows</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Overlay: When a modal window appears, it usually darkens or overlays
          the background content to bring attention to the modal and prevent
          interaction with the underlying elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus: Modal windows capture the user's focus, meaning the user cannot
          interact with the content behind the modal until they close it or
          complete the required action within the modal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Content: Modals can contain various elements such as text, forms,
          buttons, images, or any other HTML content necessary to accomplish the
          intended task.
        </li>
        <li>
          Close button: Modal windows typically include a close button (e.g., an
          "X" icon) that allows the user to dismiss the modal without taking any
          action.
        </li>
      </ul>
