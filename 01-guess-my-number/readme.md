2. The player will see a randomly generated number between 1 and 20
3. Enter a guess in the input field provided
4. Click the "Check" button to submit the guess
5. The game will provide feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low
6. If the guess is correct, the player wins the game and the score is recorded
7. The player can click the "Again" button to reset the game and start over

## Technical details

The game is built using:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript.

## Summary

The JavaScript code uses DOM manipulation to retrieve and modify elements on the page and implements game logic using conditional statements to compare the user's guess to a secret number. It also keeps track of and updates the score and high score values on the page, as well as modifies the background color and width of the mystery number element based on the game outcome. The code demonstrates the use of the Math.random() function and addEventListener() method in a number-guessing game.
