## Description
This is a simple JavaScript-based Pig Game, where two players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating scores. 
The goal is to reach a target score to win the game.


## How to Play
- Each player takes turns rolling the dice by clicking the "Roll dice" button.
- The dice roll is simulated by generating a random number between 1 and 6.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to zero, and it becomes the other player's turn. 
- If a player rolls any other number, it gets added to their current score. 
- To save the current score and add it to the player's total score, the player can click the "Hold" button. 
- The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game. 
- Clicking the "New Game" button resets the game and starts a new round.


### What I Learned
The game demonstrates the use of JavaScript's Math.random function to generate random numbers for the dice roll. 
I learned how to use the querySelector and getElementById methods to select and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript. 
By using event listeners and the addEventListener method, I learned how to listen for user input and trigger appropriate actions. 
Conditional statements are used to check the dice roll and determine the outcome, whether the player's turn continues or switches. 
I learned how to dynamically update the content of HTML elements and apply CSS classes using JavaScript. 
The game showcases the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing user experience.


### Technologies Used
- HTML: The structure and layout of the game are defined using HTML. 
- CSS: The game's visual styling and presentation are created using CSS. 
- JavaScript: The game's logic and interactivity are implemented using JavaScript.
