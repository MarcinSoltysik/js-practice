## Description

This is a simple car simulation implemented in JavaScript with a neural network controlling the car's movements.

## What I Learned

From this project, I've gained valuable insights into various concepts and skills related to JavaScript programming, neural networks, and simulation development. Here's a breakdown of what I've acquired during my work on this project:

### JavaScript Programming Skills:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The code implementation demonstrates OOP principles through the use of classes (NeuralNetwork, Level, Car, Sensor). I've learned how to structure code in a modular way, enhancing readability and maintainability.
Closures and Private Methods: The utilization of # before method names indicates private methods, showcasing the concept of closures for encapsulating functionality within a class.
Neural Networks:

2. Feedforward Neural Network: I successfully implemented a simple feedforward neural network with multiple levels to control the car's behavior.
Weights and Biases: The project involved handling weights and biases in the neural network, crucial components for adjusting the network's behavior during training.
Simulation Development:

3. Physics Simulation: I've created a fundamental physics simulation for the car's movement, incorporating aspects such as acceleration, friction, and steering.
Collision Detection: The code includes collision detection logic to assess damage based on intersections with road borders and traffic.
Canvas Drawing:

4. Canvas API: I utilized the HTML5 Canvas API for drawing the simulation elements, providing a visual representation of the car's movement and the neural network.
Algorithmic Thinking:

5. Ray Casting: The Sensor class employs ray casting to detect obstacles, showcasing my ability to think algorithmically in simulating sensors and processing their readings.
Web Development:

5. HTML and DOM Manipulation: The code includes HTML elements and manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) to set up and interact with the simulation.
This project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided hands-on experience in applying these concepts to a real-world scenario. The combination of neural networks and simulation development has given me a deeper understanding of their practical applications in JavaScript programming.


## Technologies Used

#### JavaScript:

The core language for implementing the car simulation, neural network logic, and overall project functionality.

#### HTML:

Used to structure the web page and create elements for embedding the simulation.

#### Canvas API (HTML5):

Employed for drawing and animating the simulation on an HTML canvas. The Canvas API is used to render graphics dynamically, providing a visual representation of the car's movement and the neural network.

#### LocalStorage:

Utilized for saving and loading the best-performing car's neural network, allowing persistence across browser sessions.
These technologies collectively form the foundation of a web-based simulation, showcasing the integration of JavaScript for logic, HTML for structure, and the Canvas API for dynamic graphics. The use of LocalStorage indicates the application's ability to store and retrieve data locally on the user's browser.
