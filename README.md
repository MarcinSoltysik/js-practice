## My Journey to Becoming a JS Developer

My 'practice-js' repository is a place where I document my journey from the beginning to becoming a JavaScript developer.

It is an online space where I experiment with different JavaScript techniques and learn from my mistakes and accomplishments.

## 'Digital garden'
This is my 'digital garden' where I write about:

- what I have learned,
- what I am currently learning,
- what I do.

As I continue to add to this digital garden, I hope to track my progress and gain new insights that will help me achieve my goals in the IT field.

## My projects

1. [Guess My Number](https://github.com/MarcinSoltysik/practice-js/tree/main/01-guess-my-number)

## Description

This is a simple number-guessing game built with JavaScript.
The user has to guess a random number between 1 and 20, 
and the game provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low. 
If the user guesses correctly, they win the game.

### What I learned ?

I learned how the Math.random function works, how to use the addEventListener() method in JavaScript to listen for user input, and how to use conditional statements to compare the user's guess with the secret number and provide feedback accordingly. 
I also learned how to control DOM elements by getting data from the user and how to style elements using JavaScript.

### Technologies:

- html
- css
- JS

## Description
This is a simple JavaScript-based Pig Game, where two players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating scores. The goal is to reach a target score to win the game.

### How to Play
Each player takes turns rolling the dice by clicking the "Roll dice" button.
The dice roll is simulated by generating a random number between 1 and 6.
If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to zero, and it becomes the other player's turn.
If a player rolls any other number, it gets added to their current score.
To save the current score and add it to the player's total score, the player can click the "Hold" button.
The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.
Clicking the "New Game" button resets the game and starts a new round.



### What I Learned
The game demonstrates the use of JavaScript's Math.random function to generate random numbers for the dice roll.
I learned how to use the querySelector and getElementById methods to select and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript.
By using event listeners and the addEventListener method, I learned how to listen for user input and trigger appropriate actions.
Conditional statements are used to check the dice roll and determine the outcome, whether the player's turn continues or switches.
I learned how to dynamically update the content of HTML elements and apply CSS classes using JavaScript.
The game showcases the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing user experience.


### Technologies Used
- HTML: The structure and layout of the game are defined using HTML.
- CSS: The game's visual styling and presentation are created using CSS.
- JavaScript: The game's logic and interactivity are implemented using JavaScript.
