## My Journey to Becoming a JS Developer

My 'practice-js' repository is a place where I document my journey from the beginning to becoming a JavaScript developer.

It is an online space where I experiment with different JavaScript techniques and learn from my mistakes and accomplishments.

## 'Digital garden'
This is my 'digital garden' where I write about:

- what I have learned,
- what I am currently learning,
- what I do.

As I continue to add to this digital garden, I hope to track my progress and gain new insights that will help me achieve my goals in the IT field.

## My projects

1. [Guess My Number](https://github.com/MarcinSoltysik/practice-js/tree/main/01-guess-my-number)

## Description

This is a simple number-guessing game built with JavaScript.
The user has to guess a random number between 1 and 20, 
and the game provides feedback on whether the guess was too high or too low. 
If the user guesses correctly, they win the game.

### What I learned ?

I learned how the Math.random function works, how to use the addEventListener() method in JavaScript to listen for user input, and how to use conditional statements to compare the user's guess with the secret number and provide feedback accordingly. 
I also learned how to control DOM elements by getting data from the user and how to style elements using JavaScript.

### Technologies:
