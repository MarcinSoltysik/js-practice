## My Journey to Becoming a JS Developer

My 'practice-js' repository is a place where I document my journey from the beginning to becoming a JavaScript developer.

It is an online space where I experiment with different JavaScript techniques and learn from my mistakes and accomplishments.

## 'Digital garden'
This is my 'digital garden' where I write about:

- what I have learned,
- what I am currently learning,
- what I do.

As I continue to add to this digital garden, I hope to track my progress and gain new insights that will help me achieve my goals in the IT field.
