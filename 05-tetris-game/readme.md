# Tetris

## Description

This JavaScript code creates a Tetris game within a web browser, utilizing the DOM for grid representation and defining various tetromino shapes. The game includes functions for rendering, movement, and rotation of tetrominoes, with keyboard controls for player interaction. The objective is to accumulate points by completing rows and the game ends if a tetromino reaches the top of the grid.

## What I Learned

From this project, I learned how to create a Tetris game using JavaScript, with a focus on DOM manipulation for grid representation. The concept of tetrominoes, their array-based definitions, and the dynamic rendering and erasing processes were integral to understanding game mechanics. Additionally, implementing keyboard controls for player interaction, managing the upcoming tetromino display, and incorporating scoring and game-over conditions deepened my understanding of game development fundamentals in a web environment.

### JavaScript Programming Skills:

I demonstrated proficiency in DOM manipulation by triggering the game logic upon the full loading of the Document Object Model.
My ability to interact with HTML elements and dynamically render and erase tetrominoes on the grid showcases my command over JavaScript's DOM manipulation capabilities.
The project reflects my strong knowledge of event handling, particularly in implementing keyboard controls for moving, rotating, and interacting with Tetris pieces.
I showcased a solid grasp of JavaScript's core programming concepts, including arrays, loops, and conditional statements, through the implementation of game mechanics such as scoring, freezing tetrominoes, and detecting game-over conditions.
The inclusion of a responsive mini-grid to preview upcoming tetrominoes adds complexity to the project, demonstrating my well-rounded proficiency in JavaScript for web-based game development.
